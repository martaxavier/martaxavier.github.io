I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience, where I specialised in dynamical systems modelling, machine learning and large-scale data analysis applied to neuroimaging data.  

I work at LaSEEB–Institute for Systems and Robotics at Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisboa), in collaboration with the Computational Neuroscience Group of the Center for Brain and Cognition at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona).
